# 1. Accept a file as input

As far as the file that's to be inputted I'm was unsure if I will be from a json file or a document. So I did two ways. 

## JSON
The first way is with a JSON file. The information is completely made up and was created specific for this challenge.

<!-- # 2. Accept a string value as a "search parameter"

# 3. Accept a string value as a "replacement parameter"

# 4. Count every occurrence of the value of the "search parameter" in the file

# 5. Replace each occurance of the "search parameter" with the value of the "replacement parameter"

# 6. Save the file

# 7. Output the total number of occurrences of the "search parameter", and the total number of replacements. -->
